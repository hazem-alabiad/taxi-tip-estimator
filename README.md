# Introduction
Taxi Tip Estimator (TTS) is a Data Mining project that uses the data collected by taxi drivers to estimate the tips given by customers.

The project is implemented in `R` with the help of many other Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) libraries.


# Project Proposal
Tipping someone is a common thing in our community, especially if this person is a taxi driver, waiter, or delivery officer; The tip amount varies depending on many conditions; In the case of a taxi driver, it might depend on the passenger count, trip distance, trip hour, et cetera.
In this project, we aim to study and predict the tip percentage of the total amount paid to taxi drivers. We used the data provided by NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) from this [link](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
